why not npm?
    npm can have downtime, which means if you deploy through ci, you will have
    to download all the dependencies but you won't be able to do so. instead,
    why not include the dependencies directly in your project. everyone will
    have the same version and you won't need an external service to download it.
    it's just a matter of practicality.

why is the documentation in this format?
    text files are universal, you can read the documentation hopefully in any
    device and it should look fine. more importantly, you can read this
    documentation even if you don't have internet, which is super important.
