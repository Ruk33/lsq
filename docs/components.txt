how to write components?
    components are shared pieces of ui that you can reuse in your application.
    for example, modals, alerts, buttons, etc. having said that, we know that
    components are not special at all. in order to create a "component" you
    just need to create a function that returns some html as string.

    ```
    function my_component() {
        return `<div>this is a component!</div>`
    }
    ```

how to pass properties to components?
    pass properties like a parameters like you would do with any other function.

    ```
    function my_component(color = "red") {
        return `<div style="color: ${color};">this is a component!</div>`
    }
    ```

how can i pass functions or deal with events in components?
    you can either pass the code you would like to run for each event like:

    ```
    function my_component(on_click = "") {
        return `<button onclick="${on_click}">this is a component!</button>`
    }
    ```

    or, you can accept a string of properties for the entire element:

    ```
    function my_component(props = "") {
        return `<button ${props}>this is a component!</button>`
    }
    ```

    and then use it like:

    ```
    my_component(`onclick="my_function()"`)
    ```

    it depends on your use case. if you are in doubt, go with the first example.
