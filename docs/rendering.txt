how does the application gets rendered/drawn?
    lsq takes the same approach as video games. it renders/draws the ui at 60
    frames per second. the function `html_to_draw` will get executed to know
    which html should be render.

safety considerations
    no escape gets performed automatically. you need to do it manually whenever
    it's required. for instance, having something like:

    ```
    const state = {
        username: "",
    }

    function html_to_draw() {
        return `
            <div>
                <div>username is: ${state.username}</div>
                <input type="text" oninput="state.username = event.target.value" value="${state.username}" />
            </div>
        `
    }
    ```

    could be potentially risky. if `username` contains some html, it will get
    treated as such, leaving your application open to xss attacks.

    a safer option would be to escape the values:

    ```
    function html_to_draw() {
        return `
            <div>
                <div>username is: ${state.username}</div>
                <input type="text" oninput="state.username = safe_html(event.target.value)" value="${state.username}" />
            </div>
        `
    }
    ```
