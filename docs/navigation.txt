how to define routes?
    by default, the navigation implementation will look for a field `pages` in
    your state. `pages` contains the paths/routes and the functions to call when
    the user navigates to such pages. these functions will be called with the
    parsed url parameters.

    ```
    const state = {
        pages: {
            "/": function_to_call_when_user_navigates_this_page,
            "/user/:user_id/update": update_user,
        },
    }
    ```

    if the user navigates to "/user/42/update", the function `update_user` will
    be called with a parameter `{ user_id: "42" }`

    if no page matches (404), the function `default_page_init` will be called.

    note: for now, the navigation gets done using the "#" trick. i don't quite
    like it but, it works nicely for html pages without having to set up a
    server to serve these files.

how to navigate?
    you can use the `link` component, which is just a button.

    ```
    link({ path: "/user/42/update", content: "update user" })
    ```

    or, you can programmatically navigate with `navigate_to("/user/42/update")`
